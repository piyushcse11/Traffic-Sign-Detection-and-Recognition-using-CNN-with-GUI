Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition using CNN with GUI

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for the detection and recognition of traffic signs, coupled with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy interaction. The system is designed to detect and recognize various traffic signs commonly found on roads, aiding in tasks such as autonomous driving, road safety analysis, and traffic management.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
PyQt5

Installation:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-sign-detection.git
cd traffic-sign-detection
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:
Run the GUI application:


python gui.py
Use the GUI to select an image or input a live video stream.

The system will process the input, detect and recognize traffic signs, and display the results.

Model:
The CNN architecture used in this project is trained on a dataset of labeled traffic sign images. It consists of several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers for classification. The model has been trained to recognize a variety of traffic signs commonly encountered on roads.

GUI:
The GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system. It allows users to input images or select a video stream for real-time processing. Additionally, it displays the detected traffic signs along with their corresponding labels.
